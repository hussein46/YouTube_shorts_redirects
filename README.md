# YouTube_shorts_redirects
Userscript to force YouTube Shorts to play as original videos (use default player).

Can be installed to supported browsers using Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey. I suggest the later as it is FOSS. 

Tampermonkey: [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
